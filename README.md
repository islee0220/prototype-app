# The Design Process

### Reviewing the design of existing time management tools

Bullet Journaling

- Knowledge of digital systems/technology is not needed - all you need is a journal and stationery to get started which makes it easier to learn how to use
- Greater degree of freedom and creativity to decide how you want to plan your schedule or record tasks 
- Greater opportunities to manually draw out plans - good for people who enjoy being artistic or want more visualization
- Not as convenient as a digital system that you can access from various electronic devices 
- Need to create the design/layout of everything by scratch - may be hard for those who aren’t creative or can’t draw
- May take more time to draw and write out everything in comparison to digital systems where most features can be created instantly
- Limited workspace - may be hard to fit everything within the pages of the journal
